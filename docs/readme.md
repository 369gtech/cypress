### Writing Docs

Link all pages but their name (property key) in `source/_data/sidebar.yml`

### Linting

Danger ðŸ“›: because we are minifying client side code using Hexo plugin which in turn calls
`uglify`, the code should be strictly ES5. Thus everything inside the `theme` should
be linted with ES5 settings and not upgraded to ES6.

### Deploying

#### Preferred: deploy from CI

Look at `circle.yml` file in the root of the repo. It should have 
`deploy-docs-staging` and `deploy-docs-production` jobs, which only are triggered for right
branch and only after tests pass.

#### Should not be required: manual deploy

```shell
npm run deploy
```

Look at scripts in `cy_scripts` folder for deployment steps.
